Hello, in this file there is an example of a neural network model that was designed with the help of nvidia dgx servers and computers and is free for the example.


Advanced Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow

This repository provides a complete, production-ready sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow. It includes model training, evaluation, and prediction with support for custom text inputs.

Features

Embedding Layer + BiLSTM + Attention mechanism

IMDB movie reviews dataset

Tokenization and preprocessing

Dropout and EarlyStopping

Model saving and loading

Easy inference with predict.py

Files

sentiment_model_tf.py: Core class with training and prediction logic.

predict.py: Load the model and make predictions on sample text.

requirements.txt: Python dependencies.

How to Run

1. Install requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the model

python sentiment_model_tf.py

This trains the model on IMDB data and saves it to saved_models/sentiment_model.h5.

3. Predict sentiment of new texts

python predict.py

Example Output

Text: I loved the movie, it was fantastic!
Predicted Sentiment: Positive

Text: The film was terrible and boring.
Predicted Sentiment: Negative

Requirements

See requirements.txt.

Designed for showcasing advanced deep learning models on GitHub by a professional AI engineer.
